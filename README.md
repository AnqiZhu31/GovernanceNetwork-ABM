This is an empirically grounded agent-based model (ABM) designed to simulate how stakeholders embedded in governance networks facilitate community loss-sharing and post-flood recovery in Guangzhou, China. The model investigates how network structures, stakeholder trust, and the diffusion of flood resilience measures within governance networks influence community flood resilience.
